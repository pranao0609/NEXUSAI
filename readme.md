# Multi-Agent System Project

## Overview
This project implements a Multi-Agent System (MAS) with 14 autonomous agents that collaborate and coordinate across different domains such as Research, Health, and Education. Each agent has specific roles and behaviors, allowing the system to demonstrate decentralized decision-making, knowledge sharing, and distributed problem-solving.

The system demonstrates:
- Multiple specialized agents working together
- Domain-specific reasoning and communication
- Task allocation and cooperation among agents
- Scalability and fault tolerance

---

## Features
- Fourteen distinct agents representing real-world domains  
- Knowledge exchange and message passing between agents  
- Distributed decision-making and task handling  
- Easy extension to add new domain-specific agents  
- Fault tolerance with minimal disruption if an agent fails

## Agent List
The system is composed of the following 14 agents, grouped into domains:

**Research Domain Agents**
1. Literature Review Agent  
2. Data Collection Agent  
3. Data Analysis Agent  
4. Reporting Agent  

**Health Domain Agents**
5. Patient Monitoring Agent  
6. Diagnosis Agent  
7. Treatment Recommendation Agent  
8. Health Record Management Agent  

**Education Domain Agents**
9. Student Performance Tracking Agent  
10. Learning Resource Recommendation Agent  
11. Curriculum Planning Agent  
12. Examination Management Agent  

**Cross-Domain Agents**
13. Communication and Coordination Agent  
14. Knowledge Integration Agent

## Architecture
- **Environment Layer** – Represents the context in which agents operate  
- **Agent Layer** – Fourteen agents with domain-specific modules:  
  - Perception (input gathering)  
  - Decision (reasoning and planning)  
  - Action (executing tasks)  
- **Communication Layer** – Manages inter-agent messaging and protocols
